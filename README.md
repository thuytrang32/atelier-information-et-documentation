# Student Performance Prediction

## Project goal
The goal of this project is to analyze student characteristics and educational context in order to predict academic performance.

Two predictive models are developed:
- Model 1 predicts the second period grade (G2)
- Model 2 predicts the final grade (G3)

The models use demographic, social, and academic features to estimate student grades.
