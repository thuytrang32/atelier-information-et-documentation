# Data Card — Student Performance Data

## Dataset identification and provenance

- **Name**: Student Performance Data

## Target variables

Though the dataset contains multiple grade-related columns, I select two targets for my models:

- **Target 1**: G3-final grade  
- **Target 2**: G2-second period grade

This choice allows training two distinct regression models while keeping the dataset simple.
